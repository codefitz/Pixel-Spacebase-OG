## What's Different?

The aim is to convert Pixel Dungeon into a fully fledged Spacebase Exploration/Escape RPG.

Major Changes:

* 4 new characters
* Smoother gameplay - hunger does not interrupt, items are picked up before attack, follow up NPC windows relegated to log
* Item degredation is gone
* Level size generation completely random
* Scrolls of identity no longer wasted
* Shop on all levels (for now)

Changes in progress:

* Reskin/Names of all textures and sprites
* Story elements
* Game tweaks
* Bug fixing

Changes planned:

* Oxygen mechanics
* Armor Perma-buffs
* Modules and upgrades
